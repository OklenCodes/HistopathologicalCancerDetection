# HistopathologicalCancerDetection
My attempt at the Kaggle Competition - Histopathological Cancer Detection - https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview

Identifying metastatic tissues in histopathological scans of lymph node selections

Recieved 0.9667 Kaggle Score

Keras has changed a few things within the ImageDataGenerator which is something i had to learn on the task. I will be practising with the framework on more projects

Train and Test files too large to add but they can be found on kaggle
